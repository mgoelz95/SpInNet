# SpInNet
Real-world wireless sensor network for indoor detection and localization. See the paper [Goelz2024EUSIPCO] available at https://www.researchgate.net/publication/381761991_Spatial_Inference_Network_Indoor_Proximity_Detection_via_Multiple_Hypothesis_Testing.

The `SpInNet` package provides code for and data recorded with a real-world large-scale wireless sensor network that uses relative humidity (rH) measurements to detect the presence of anomalous events in an indoor environments. Such events can be, for instance, the presence of people or an open door/window. The methods for inference were developped in previous work and its implementation is available as well, see the repository https://github.com/mgoelz95/lfdr-sMoM/. In addition, these methods are implemented in the python package ´spatialmht´ (https://pypi.org/project/spatialmht/).

This repository contains 
  1) annotated data recorded with our real-world network that can be used for your own work if you reference [Goelz2024EUSIPCO]. We provide two data sets: 'eusipco', which was used in the paper and 'bonus', which was not used in the paper due to lack of space. The data is in /csv/ and provided as csv files.
  2) code to process the data and generate inference results. 
  3) code to build your own network. Directory /running_the_network/ provides the python and arduino code that can be used directly to run your build your own spatial inference network, if would like to record your own measurements. Again, make sure to cite [Goelz2024EUSIPCO] if you use this code. 


Installation
------------

To install the package:

```
pip install spatialmht
```

Make sure you have ´spatialmht v2.1.1' installed. Execute /processing_data/process_sensor_data_to_pvals.py to generate p-values from the csv datafiles. Then execute /processing_data/produce_results.py to obtain inference results. See the comments in the scripts to learn about all options and plotting capabilities provided.
